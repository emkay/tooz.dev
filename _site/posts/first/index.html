            <p>The last week or so I've made a commitment to myself to learn <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I've made a couple attempts over the last five years or so and have made progress here and there, but never had a project to work on. I'd make my way through <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>, and write a couple little things and that was it. There would be huge gaps where I wouldn't write any Rust. Then I would go back and it was just like learning all over again.</p>
<p>This time I am going to keep it up. I've been making my way through the book again, I've gone through all of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a>, I'm listening to <a href="https://newrustacean.com/">The New Rustacean Podcast</a>, and I've started working on a CLI project that will help me use the things I am learning from all the resources.</p>
