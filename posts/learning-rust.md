The last week or so I've made a commitment to myself to learn <a class="{{linkClass}}" href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. I've made a couple attempts over the last five years or so and have made progress here and there, but never had a project to work on. I'd make my way through <a class="{{linkClass}}" href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">the book</a>, and write a couple little things and that was it. There was huge gaps where I wouldn't write any Rust. Then I would go back and it was just like learning all over again.

This time I am going to keep it up. I am making my way through the book again, I've gone through all of <a class="{{linkClass}}" href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings">Rustlings</a>, listening to <a class="{{linkClass}}" href="https://newrustacean.com/">The New Rustacean Podcast</a>, and I've started working on a CLI project that will help me use the things I am learning from all the resources.

Rust is not _easy_ to learn for me. I've been programming for over twenty years now, and have picked up multiple languages along the way, but Rust is very different (in a great way) than what I am used to. The community is great though and it's pretty fun to try something different.

The goal of this is to know Rust as well as I know javascript and node. It took years and years to get to that point. I don't expect it to be any different with Rust. I'm not doing this only for fun either. The ultimate goal is to position my career so that I am writing Rust full time.

This place is going to be used as my scratch pad. Sometimes I will write about what I am working on, or write out notes for things I don't quite understand. This type of note taking, writing, and editing helps me learn. Throughout the process I am going to keep a list of all the resources that I go through. I've already linked some here, but I am going to have a separate page of resources.
